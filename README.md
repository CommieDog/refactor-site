# Refactor Website for Accessibility

## Description 

This project was undertaken for a marketing agency client who wanted to refactor their website codebase to meet basic accessibility standards. The client wanted the basic look-and-feel of the website unchanged; the changes made "under the hood" aimed to perserve the website for unimpared human users while being more accessible to impared users and search engines.

A substantial portion of the work involved adding semantic HTML to the webpage. The final product makes use of several semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>`. Elements within sections were reordered in a logical fashion, while their layouts were modified to match the original layout of the webpage via CSS properties. Header elements wwere reclassified to match good practice and images were given alternate descriptors. Finally, a refactoring of the CSS stylesheet was undertaken, simplifying selector criteria and adding comments.

Future work on this project would likely come in the form of improved accessibility, partucularly for users with small screen sizes. The basic layout of the webpage is not stable when squeezed into small sizes, and a few visual elements are too indistinct even for nonimpared users to notice. In particular, the Benefits section would benefit from the use of flexboxes.

## Table of Contents

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
